# Techdegree Project 4: Build a Web Style Guide

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below:

- Create a 'scss' folder in your "Responsive Layout" project.
- Convert the CSS stylesheet to an SCSS stylesheet, then place it inside the 'scss' folder.
- Run Sass from the console or with a tool like CodeKit, Workspaces, or any of these.
- In the 'scss' folder, create subfolders to organize your CSS code into Sass partial files.
	•	For example for base styles, layout, components, and so on.
	•	Create at least three folders.
- Group related sections of CSS into SCSS partials.
	•	For example, base styles for elements can go inside a _base.scss partial inside the 'base' folder.
	•	Create at least 3 Sass partial files.
- Import your partials into your project's main SCSS file.
	•	When using multiple @import’s make sure they are listed in the correct order for styling.	
- Find repeating patterns in the stylesheet and extract them into placeholder selectors, then extend them wherever necessary.
	•	At a minimum create at least one placeholder selector, and use it with the @extend keyword in at least 3 other selectors.
- Create variables for repeating values. At a minimum create variables for colors, font-sizes and font-family values
-	Write mixins for media queries.
- Create at least one example of a nested Sass rule.
- No nested rules greater than 3 levels deep.
		
## Brief Summary of my project

## Grade Received:
